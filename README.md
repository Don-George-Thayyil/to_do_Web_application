# to_do_Web_application

This application contains three APIs. One for fetching task-list, one for adding tasks to the list, and one for getting the count of tasks.
I have used Node.js, Express and Mongo for this project. The native mongodb driver is used for database consumption.
The initial files and organizaton is generated by default using the express generator. Aside from that seperate folderssuch as config and
helpers are added for the ease of access.
config folder contains connection.js file which is used to establish the database connection. Helper folder contains helper function which
helps to fetch/insert data from/to the database.
These helper functions are called by the router functions inside the routes folder. It contains files that provides responses/render webpages 
with help of handlebar engine.
The view folder contains the templates for the web pages.
The public folder contains static files required for the application. The app.js file is the main file which controls the overall working of 
the web application. The routes, database connection etc are established inside this file.
The package.json file contains the necessery information about dependencies and such required for the working of the web application.
